# Data-Exploration-on-GENZ-Data-Using-SQL

Overview:
This project aims to explore and analyze data related to Generation Z (Gen Z) using SQL queries. The data is stored in a MySQL database managed through MySQL Workbench and connected to a local MySQL instance.

Prerequisites:
MySQL Workbench installed on your machine.
Access to a local MySQL instance (e.g., MySQL Server 8.0).
Basic knowledge of SQL querying.

Setup:

Database Setup:
Ensure your MySQL server is running.
Create a new database named genzdataset.
Import the 4 datasets(learning, Manager,Missions and persnolised_info) dataset into the genz_project database using MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line.

Connecting MySQL Workbench:
Open MySQL Workbench.
Connect to your local MySQL instance.
Use the genzdataset database for executing SQL queries.

Running SQL Queries:
Open the SQL files provided in the project repository using MySQL Workbench or any text editor.
Execute SQL queries to explore and analyze the Gen Z dataset.
Ensure proper syntax and understanding of each query before execution.

Project Structure:
sql2.sql: Contains SQL queries for data exploration and analysis.
README.md: Provides project information and setup instructions.
all other are datasets used for analysis 

Files Description:
